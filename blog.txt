     On April 22, 2025, the serene meadows of Baisaran in Pahalgam, Kashmir—usually a retreat for honeymooners and hikers—turned into a site of bloodshed. Militants opened fire on a group of tourists, killing at least 26 and injuring many more. The Resistance Front (TRF) later claimed responsibility, asserting that these were not "innocent tourists" but individuals tied to Indian security establishments. Regardless of the claimed intent, the carnage was real. The grief was real. And the questions it raises are all too familiar.



I. Evidence of Violence: Patterns, Not Isolated Events

This was not the first time Kashmir bled under the shadow of insurgency. From the attacks on pilgrims in Anantnag (2017) to assaults on tourists in Gulmarg, the valley has seen a historical pattern—each incident a grim addition to a long-standing conflict that has its roots deep in territorial and ideological disputes.



Statistical data from government and independent sources show a steady rise and fall in militancy-related violence. According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, there have been over 45,000 fatalities in Jammu & Kashmir since 1989, including civilians, militants, and security personnel. The overarching theme? Territory. The same primal motivation that fueled the trenches of World War I and the gas chambers of World War II—land, control, power.



War, whether by states or insurgents, has always hidden behind grand narratives but marched to the same drumbeat: possession.



II. Evolution: The Only Undeniable Evidence of Who We Are

Amid the noise of ideology, religion, and nationalism, there exists an evidence we continue to ignore—our shared evolutionary history. We all descend from the same early Homo sapiens who first walked the African savannahs. We are one species. Our DNA does not recognize caste, creed, or border.



"Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is."

– Albert Camus



Evolution is change. It is the rejection of rigidity. It is the biological record of experimentation, failure, and adaptation. And yet, we humans—ironically the most adaptive species—cling to static constructs of religion and identity, often to justify division and violence.



Philosophers like Karl Popper spoke of evolutionary epistemology—the idea that knowledge evolves like species do, through variation, error, and selection. So why do we expect moral laws and social norms crafted millennia ago to remain eternally valid?



III. Religion: Story or Structure?

Let us not demonize religion—it has given us beautiful metaphors, rich mythologies, and ethical guidelines. But myths are stories. And stories should evolve. The danger lies not in faith, but in fossilizing it. When stories meant to inspire turn into strictures meant to control, we lose the essence of their wisdom.



"A myth is something that never happened, but is always happening."

– Joseph Campbell



Let the Ramayana inspire discipline and devotion—not justify caste hierarchies. Let the Quran’s poetic prose ignite reflection—not rigid regulation. Let the Bible’s parables urge compassion—not crusades.



Evidential learning—learning from experience, from history, from science—offers a living alternative. One that adapts. One that questions. One that grows.



IV. The Way Forward: Reclaiming Our Humanity Through Evolution

The Pahalgam attack is not just another act of terror; it's a rupture in our collective memory. A reminder that despite satellites in space and AI in our phones, our minds still live in tribes.



“We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience.”

– Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, paleontologist and philosopher



Teilhard believed evolution was not just physical, but spiritual and social. That humanity is evolving toward greater unity and consciousness. But this evolution requires participation. It demands we break the rigid molds—of religion, of nation, of race—and build anew from the common clay of our origins.



Every war ever fought—from global cataclysms to regional riots—has been about land. But the only territory truly worth claiming is the one between our ears: our consciousness. Our ability to change.
